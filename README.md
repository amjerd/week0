# ðŸŽ“ Student Info Smart Contract

A simple Solidity smart contract that allows students to **store** and **retrieve** their personal information (name and score) on the blockchain.  
This project was created to learn how to use **structs**, **mappings**, and **functions** in Solidity.

---

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The goal of this contract is to help users understand:
- How to define and use **structs** in Solidity  
- How to use **mappings** to associate data with string(reg No) 
- How to write functions that store and read blockchain data  

Each studentâ€™s information is tied to their registration number no duplication.  
This means every Registration number can store its own name and score without affecting others.
